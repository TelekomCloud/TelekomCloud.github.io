Did you know Deutsche Telekom AG has been using and developing OpenStack-based clouds for the last 1.5 years? We first publicly talked about our OpenStack efforts at [CeBIT 2012](http://www.telekom.com/media/media-kits/104982) in March 2012 and at the OpenStack Folsom Design Summit in San Francisco. A lot has happened since then! While OpenStack Essex was not fully ready to meet our requirements, we have been in production with OpenStack Folsom for a while now. Currently our Cloud Development and Operations team is busy preparing the launch of our OpenStack Grizzly-based cloud.

With the creation of this team blog, we want to share our ideas and findings in and around OpenStack and discuss them with the community. We are looking forward to the conversation!
